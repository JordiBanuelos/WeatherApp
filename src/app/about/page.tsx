        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Hi! I'm <strong>Yair Jordi Banuelos</strong>, a passionate Computer Science major at Northeastern Illinois University, 
          with a minor in Network Security and Applied Mathematics. I'm currently a NOAA EPP/MSI Scholar and an aspiring machine learning engineer.
        </p>
  
        <p className="mt-4 text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          I enjoy building projects that intersect climate science and intelligent systems. Recently, I’ve been 
          working on developing a weather visualization app using real-time sensor data from Waggle edge nodes. 
          I’ve also contributed to the NOAA TOWR-S team, enhancing tools used in meteorological forecasting.
        </p>
  
        <p className="mt-4 text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Outside of research and development, I tutor CS students, enjoy exploring open-source software, 
          and am always looking for ways to apply technology to solve real-world problems.
        </p>
